If find is set to print the found file’s base directory followed by the found file’s name (-printf ’%H %P\n’) and there exist directories of
different length, then find incorrectly splits base directory and file name during printing. Because the index state.starting_path is set only for the
first working directory (ftsfind.c:278-279) the incorrect value of state.starting_path is used when printing base directory and file name
(pred.c:709-718, pred.c:813). Examples of Correct Fixes: 1) Recompute state.starting_path length for each argv before calling find.
2) Weaken condition that prevents state.starting_path_length to be reset. Example of Incorrect Fix: Always update state.starting_path_length
even if ent->fts level != 0 (Regression because it then carries the incorrect ”starting_path_length”).
