If grep is set to search all TXT files (–include=”*.txt”) but excluding some
files (–exclude=”foo.txt”), then grep also searches files that are not TXT
ignoring the include option. Because included patterns is not initialized with
EXCLUDE_WILDCARDS (src/grep.c:2137), the exclude pattern is not added in
add_exclude (lib/exclude.c:449). Files are matched exactly (treating ”*.txt” as
file name) instead of using wildcards (lib/exclude.c:417-427). These files are
then incorrectly classified as included/excluded (src/grep.c:2261-2271).

Examples of Correct Fixes: 
1) Add EXCLUDE_WILDCARDS flag for includes. 
2) Add EXCLUDE_INCLUDE flags for excludes if there are includes. 

Examples of Incorrect Fixes: 
1) Substitute EXCLUDE_INCLUDE with EXCLUDE_WILDCARDS for includes (Regression
because EXCLUDE_INCLUDE flags must also be set for includes). 

2) Negate condition that decides whether to exclude (Regression because files
that are specified to be excluded are now included).
