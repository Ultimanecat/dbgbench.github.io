If find is set to search a directory containing a symbolic link, to not follow any symbolic links (except for those specified on the command
line; -H), and to print only symbolic links (-type l), then find does not print the link. The root cause is that state.cur depth is used before
it is set. When digest mode checks whether to follow symlinks (util.c:629), state.curdepth is still 0 (util.c:607), so that mode are
incorrectly set to follow symlinks (util.c:630-636). Only later state.curdepth is set (ftsfind.c:230). Because of the incorrect value
of mode, it is incorrectly decided not to print the file (pred.c:1749). Example of Correct Fix: Move state.curdepth assignment to shortly
before digest mode is called. Examples of Incorrect Fixes: 1) Change check to match incorrect value (0) of state.curdepth (Treating the
Symptom). 2) Force stat() to be called such that stat information is available (Incorrect Workaround because stat() is not supposed to be called
on symlink loops).
