* P: patch is Plausible (passes our test case)
* C: patch is Correct (passes our code review)

| Participant ID | P | C | Strategy | Category | Rationale |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| YTA2MTE4ND | 1 | 1 | Use copy of old argument pointer during error-reporting. | Different but Correct |  |
| ZTk0ZThkOD | 1 | 1 | Use copy of old argument pointer during error-reporting. | Different but Correct |  |
| OTcyZjg1Mz | 1 | 1 | Use copy of old argument pointer during error-reporting. | Different but Correct |  |

| MGJmMTU1N2 | 1 | 1 | Decrement/restore arg_ptr when parsing of second argument of an option fails. Add null pointer check. | Developer Fix |  |
| ZTRmYWE5Nj | 1 | 0 | Decrement argument pointer before even calling parse_time | Regression | Now, even correct arguments are reported as incorrect ones. |
