find -H/-L symlink_to_dir reports "Too many levels of symbolic links"

Lets say we have the following directory structure
$ mkdir dir 
$ ln -s dir link 
$ touch dir/file 

Executing find on the linked directory not follow symbolic links (-H)
$ ./find -H link 
link 
./find: link: Too many levels of symbolic links 

This happens also if find is asked to follow symbolic links (-L)
$ ./find -L link 
link 
./find: link: Too many levels of symbolic links 

However, it should actually show:
$ ./find -H link 
link 
link/file 
$ ./find -L link 
link 
link/file
