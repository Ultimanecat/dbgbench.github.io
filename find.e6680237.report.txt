find -execdir does not change working directory

Lets say, we create the following directory structure:
$ mkdir -p /tmp/{foo,bar,baz}/bug

If I search for all directories in /tmp containing a folder called bug and execute pwd, I get the following output:
$ ./find /tmp -name bug -execdir pwd \;
/tmp/bar
/tmp/bar
/tmp/bar

Instead, I would expect in some order the names of all three folders containing the bug-folder
$ ./find /tmp -name bug -execdir pwd \;
/tmp/bar
/tmp/foo
/tmp/baz
