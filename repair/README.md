# Evaluation of Automated Repair Techniques
## Motivation

## Qualitative evaluation without user study
Using DBGBench, we can evaluate the *correctness* of the auto-generated patches. We provide the [patches](../patches) generated by the participants, elicit the general fix strategies, and classify them as correct and incorrect. For each incorrect patch, we provide a rationale as to why we classify it as incorrect. For some incorrect patches, we even provide test cases that show their incorrectness.

* To conduct a *plausibility check*, you could execute the existing test suite and the previously failing test cases and confirm that all test cases pass. Concrete steps are provided [here](../patches). For GNU findutils, the developers have constructed a test suite in excess of 1{,}000 test cases. However, plausible patches (i.e., those passing the test suite) are not necessarily also correct (i.e., those passing a code review). 
* Hence, to conduct an additional *regression check*, we would execute the additional test cases for the participant-provided, incorrect patches. The execution of this extended test suite allows to test for common mistakes when auto-generating a patch.


## Qualitative evaluation with user study
Using DBGBench, you can significantly reduce the time and effort required for user studies (e.g., the manual review of auto-generated patches). Users can leverage bug diagnosis, simplified and extended regression test cases, the bug report, the bug diagnosis, fault locations, and developer-provided patches to make the call.

* User studies can be used to evaluate *patch acceptability*, whether users would accept the auto-generated patches. For instance, Kim et al. i) asked several students to rate the acceptability of patches generated by GenProg, Par, and a developer for five bugs on a 3-point Likert scale, and ii) asked several students and practitioners to choose the most acceptable from a pair of human-generated and auto-generated patches. Similar user studies can leverage DBGBench to extract the correct/incorrect patches provided by professional software engineers. 
* [DBGBench](../dbgbench.summary.pdf) includes the *time taken* by professional software engineers to fix real-world software bugs. We can use these timing information to evaluate the *usefulness* of an automated program repair tool. To this end, we can design an experiment involving several software professionals and measure the reduction in debugging time while using an automated program repair tool.
