find -H seems to incorrectly follow symbolic links in some cases

$ mkdir tempdir
$ ln -s / tempdir/symlink

If we specify to not *follow* symlinks but only show symlinks, it won't show the symlink.
$ ./find -H tempdir -type l
(prints nothing)

However, it should print:
$ ./find -H tempdir -type l
/tmp/tempdir/symlink

It works correctly if only '-H' or only '-type l' is specified.
