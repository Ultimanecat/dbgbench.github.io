segfault: -neweraa without a following argument

$ ./find -neweraa 
Segmentation fault (core dumped) 

Instead it should print
$ ./find -neweraa 
./find: The `-neweraa' test needs an argument

The same problem is observed for
$ ./find -newercc
Segmentation fault (core dumped) 
$ ./find -newermm 
Segmentation fault (core dumped) 


Here's an excerpt of the manual
-newerXY reference
Succeeds if timestamp X of the file being considered is newer than timestamp Y of the file reference. The letters X and Y can be any of the following letters:
a   The access time of the file reference
B   The birth time of the file reference
c   The inode status change time of reference
m   The modification time of the file reference
t   reference is interpreted directly as a time
