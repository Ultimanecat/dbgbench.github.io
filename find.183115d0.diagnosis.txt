If we ulimit the number file descriptors that can be open simulatanously and set find to execute ls for every subdirectory (-execdir ls ’{}’
\;), it quickly runs out of file descriptors. File descriptors are always opened (pred.c:520) but never closed (pred.c:659-664) which
raises an error when no more descriptors are available (pred.c:579). Example of Correct Fix: Close file descriptor as soon as it is not
used anymore. Example of Incorrect Fix: Close random file descriptor (Incomplete Fix because still leaking file descriptors).
