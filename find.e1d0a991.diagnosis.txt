If find is set to a directory containing a file, to follow symbolic links (-L),
and to execute ls for every subdirectory (-execdir ls ’{}’ \;), then find
incorrectly also prints the base directory. If find is set to follow symlinks,
the flag FTS_LOGICAL is set (ftsfind.c:349) before the directory search is
initiated (ftsfind.c:364). When a directory is searched (ftsfind.c:373), the
working directory is not changed because FTS_LOGICAL is set. Hence, the *full*
pathname is passed as argument to execdir (pred.c:484-490 and pred.c:467-471). 

Example of Correct Fix: 
Correctly compute pathname and prefix in new_impl_pred_exec. 

Example of Incorrect Fix: 
Remove FTS_LOGICAL flag (Incorrect Workaround because FTS_LOGICAL is supposed
to be set).
