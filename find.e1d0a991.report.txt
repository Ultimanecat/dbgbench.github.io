-L breaks -execdir

Lets say, we create a file 'b' in a directory 'a'.
$ mkdir a
$ touch a/b

If we execute the following, we what I would expect
$ ./find a -name b -execdir ls {} \;
./b

However, if I also ask find to follow symlinks, it breaks:
$ ./find -L a -name b -execdir ls {} \;
./a/b

Of course, I would expect the same behavior as without symlinks.
$ ./find -L a -name b -execdir ls {} \;
./b
