If find is set to search for files (-type f) while following symbolic links (-L) and a symbolic link loop exists, then it aborts with a coredump
instead of listing the symbolic links and terminating gracefully. If a symbolic link loop exists, no stat information is available and the flag
FTS_NS is set (ftsfind:584). The flag is not properly handled (ftsfind.c:425-446), such that state.type and mode are incorrectly
set (ftsfind.c:460) and the assertion fails (pred.c:1578). Example of Correct Fix: Handle FTS_NS flag. Examples of Incorrect
Fixes: 1) Remove violated assertion (Treating the Symptom). 2) Force stat() to be called such that stat information is available (Incorrect
Workaround because stat() is not supposed to be called on symlink loops).
