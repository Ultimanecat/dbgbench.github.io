infinite loop with -follow.

$ mkdir testingfindagain 
$ ln -s . testingfindagain/symlink 
$ ./find testingfindagain -follow 
will generate an endless loop. (For testing I suggest piping into head -c 200, otherwise you might trigger OOM) 

The expected output is
./find: Symbolic link `testingfindagain/symlink' is part of a loop in the directory hierarchy; we have already visited the directory to which it points. 
testingfindagain 
testingfindagain/symlink
