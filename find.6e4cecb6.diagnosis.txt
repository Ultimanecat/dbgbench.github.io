If find is set to search a directory referenced by a symbolic link and
containing a file, and find is set to follow symbolic links (-L) or to not
follow symbolic links except for those set to be searched (-H), then find does
not print the file in the referenced directory and instead reports ”Too many
levels of symbolic links”. Because of a mixup in the condition of a ternary
operator (find.c:1094), extraflags are set to O_NOFOLLOW when it should be 0
and to 0 when it should be O_NOFOLLOW. The flag controls whether symlinks are
followed when a directory is opened (find.c:1097). Because of this fault,
safely_chdir returns SafeChdirFailSymlink (find.c:1618) whence the error
message is printed (find.c:1642). 

Example of Correct Fix: 
Fix ternary operator. 

Example of Incorrect Fix: 
Do not fail if safely_chdir returns SafeChdirFailSymlink
(Treating the Symptom).
