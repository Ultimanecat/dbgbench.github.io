--include not working as expected

The --include option seems completely broken to me. I've tried using various combinations of backslashes, single and double quotes on the --include parameter, but to no avail. 

$ echo x > 1
$ ./grep --include=1 x 1
(nothing printed)

Instead, what it should print is
$ ./grep --include=1 x 1 
x
