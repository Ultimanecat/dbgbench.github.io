If find is set to print files that are strictly younger than 2 days (-mtime -2), it will instead print files that are exactly 2 days old. The
function get_comp_type actually increments the argument pointer timearg (parser.c:3175). So, when the function is called the first time
(parser.c:3109), timearg still points to ’-’. However, when it is called the second time (parser.c:3038), timearg already points to ’2’
such that it is incorrectly classified as COMP_EQ (parser.c:3178). Examples of Correct Fixes: 1) Save timearg in auxiliary variable
and restore after first call to get_comp_type. 2) Pass a copy of timearg into the first call of get_comp_type. 3) Pass a copy of timearg into
get relative timestamp (which calls get_comp_type the second time). 4) Decrement timearg after the first call to get_comp_type. Example
of Incorrect Fix: Restore timearg only if classified as COMP_LT (Incomplete Fix because it does not solve the problem for -mtime +2).
