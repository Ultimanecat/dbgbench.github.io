If find is set to search a directory containing a symbolic link that references
an ancistor directory and if find is set to follow symlinks (-follow), then it
runs indefinitely. The global variable dir_ids tracks the directories that have
already been visited. The function process_path would correctly exit with a
loop warning (find.c:1428-1434) if the current directory (in stat buf) has
already been visited. However, after the current directory is correctly added
to those that have already been visited (find.c:1442), the same entry is
overriden with uninitialized values (find.c:1621) such that the current
directory is never marked as already visited. 

Examples of Correct Fixes: 
1) Remember whether stat() has been called. If not done, call stat() before
overriding dir_ids[dir_curr] at find/find.c:1621. 

2) Always stat() before overriding dir_ids[dir_curr] at find/find.c:1621 such
that statbuf is initialized. 

3) Only overwrite dir_ids[dir_curr] if statbuf is initialized. 

Examples of Incorrect Fixes: 
1) Never override dir_ids[dir_curr] (Regression because it isnâ€™t overridden
when it should be). 

2) Follow links to a maximum depth of 1 (Regression because symlinks might need
to be followed to an arbitrary depth).
