find does not report symlink loop when trying to follow symlinks

$ ln -s a b 
$ ln -s b a 
$ ./find -L a/foo 
a/foo 

I would expect something like:
$ ./find -L a/foo 
./find: `a/foo': Too many levels of symbolic links

Here find is reporting that a file called a/foo exists, which is obviously not the case.
